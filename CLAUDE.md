# BA-kit Instructions For Claude Code

## Canonical Sources

- `core/contract.yaml`
- `core/contract-behavior.md` plus the command shard in `core/behavior/` listed by `core/contract.yaml.behavior_shards`
- `skills/ba-start/SKILL.md` - lifecycle stub that dispatches into the active step file

For lifecycle work, read `contract.yaml`, then shared behavior, then only the selected command behavior shard and step file.

For non-trivial BA work, start from `skills/ba-start/SKILL.md` instead of improvising from the prompt alone.

## Core Defaults

- Write BA deliverables in Vietnamese unless the user explicitly requests English.
- Default to `hybrid` mode for solo IT BA work.
- Persist project memory on disk; do not rely on Claude chat memory as the system of record.
- Apply runtime-neutral HITL behavior from `core/contract-behavior.md` and the selected shard.

## Runtime Guardrails

If a wrapper or operator supplies a guardrail preflight packet for `frd`, `stories`, `package`, `status`, or `next`, treat that packet as the authoritative runtime constraint.

- Honor `status`, `message`, `guardrail_mode`, `allow_reads`, `deny_reads`, `indexes`, and `refresh_command` exactly as supplied.
- If `status=block`, stop before lifecycle work and surface `refresh_command` instead of proceeding.
- Treat an index as truly current only when the packet already reflects producer-side validation; do not assume a freshly generated index is trusted before `validated_at` and `validated_by` exist.
- When the packet says an index is current, use only the allowlisted files for discovery and prefer any generated excerpt files over reopening the full source artifact.
- Do not discovery-read a full artifact that appears in `deny_reads` unless you first emit `READ_ESCALATION: {command} read {path} due to {reason}.`
- If an `action_guardrail` or `ACTION_GUARDRAIL` reminder is present, obey it on that action even if earlier turns already mentioned the same backbone route.
- For `status` and `next`, `PROJECT-HOME.md` may help explain state to the user but must not override canonical artifact resolution.
- Keep the runtime payload compact; do not ask for the full guardrail policy again when the packet already supplies the verdict and exact path hints.

### Output Modes

Adapters and wrappers emit one of three output modes. Use the smallest mode that satisfies the action:

| Mode | When to use | Required fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `probe` | no-op, clarification, or block verdict | `output_mode`, `status`, `command`, `resolved_slug`, `message` |
| `delta` | index-first action with changed state | probe fields + `indexes.<name>.state`, `action_guardrail` (if present), `allow_reads`, `excerpt_path` (if built) |
| `full` | escalation, broad read, or first-run with no index | delta fields + `deny_reads`, `canonical_state_summary`, `canonical_next_command`, `refresh_command` (if block) |

Rules:
- `probe` is the default for `status=block` and no-op responses; do not add delta or full fields.
- `delta` is the default for `status=ok` or `status=warn` when an index is current.
- `full` is required only when `READ_ESCALATION` is emitted or no current index exists.
- Receipt contracts (`impact_receipt`, `options_receipt`, `index_validation_receipt`) are separate artifacts; do not embed their content in the runtime packet.

## Artifact Model

- Project root: `plans/{slug}-{date}/`
- Project Home: `PROJECT-HOME.md`
- Intake and plan: `01_intake/`
- Backbone and memory: `02_backbone/`
- Module artifacts: `03_modules/{module_slug}/`
- Compiled HTML: `04_compiled/`
- Delegation and collaboration: `delegation/`, `COLLAB-HOME.md`, `MODULE-HOME.md`

## Delegation

Use agent roles under `agents/` when delegation improves quality or throughput.

- `requirements-engineer` for backbone, FRD, stories, and selective SRS content
- `ui-ux-designer` for wireframe constraint packs and manual handoff checklists
- `ba-documentation-manager` for validation, quality review, and packaging
- `ba-researcher` for domain research

Pass narrow packets: exact path, write scope, trace IDs, and targeted excerpts.

## BA-Friendly UX

Use `PROJECT-HOME.md` to resume. Lead with friendly labels, then show commands: tao du an moi -> intake; tiep tuc -> next; thay doi -> impact; handoff UI -> wireframes; ban giao -> package.

Route module collaboration NLP to `ba-collab`. Commit/push/PR/merge require explicit approval.
