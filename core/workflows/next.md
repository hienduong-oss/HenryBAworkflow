<purpose>
Detect the next logical BA step from the current BA-kit artifact set.

This command is the BA equivalent of a lightweight state machine. It reads the current project
artifacts and recommends the next exact command.  It must stay deterministic and compact — no
broad artifact reads, no content parsing beyond what is needed to classify state.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read `contract.yaml` and `contract-behavior.md` only.  Do not read full backbone, stories, or SRS
to compute the next step.
</required_reading>

<discovery_strategy>
Snapshot-first, then stat-only fallback:

1. Check for `plans/{slug}-{date}/02_backbone/package-snapshot.md`.
   - If present and `snapshot_state: current`, derive artifact existence from its `artifacts` list.
   - If absent or `snapshot_state: degraded`, fall back to filesystem stat checks only.
2. Read `paths.plan` header (first 30 lines) to detect options status and selected option.
3. Do not read backbone content, stories content, or SRS content to determine the next step.
4. Emit `READ_ESCALATION: next read {path} due to {reason}` only when content is genuinely
   required to resolve an ambiguous gate (e.g., backbone gate section missing from snapshot).
</discovery_strategy>

<process>

<step name="resolve_project">
Resolve the target slug and dated set using the artifact contract.

Rules:
- prefer explicit `--slug`
- otherwise detect a single existing project set from exact BA-kit artifact patterns
- if ambiguous, stop and ask the user to choose
- when the next exact command would be module-scoped (`frd`, `stories`, `srs`, or `wireframes`),
  resolve the module using the contract rules before emitting the command
- if multiple module directories exist, stop and ask instead of emitting an incomplete
  module-scoped command
</step>

<step name="check_checkpoint">
Before inspecting artifacts, read both checkpoint files for the resolved project:
- `/ba-start` checkpoint: `plans/{slug}-{date}/_checkpoint.md`
- `/ba-presale` checkpoint: `plans/{slug}-{date}/00_presale/_checkpoint.md`

If either checkpoint file exists and `status: running`:
- The previous session was interrupted mid-step.
- Determine the flow from the `step` field:
  - Presale steps (`bootstrap`, `domain-study`, `clarify`, `build`, `handoff`) → **presale flow**
  - All other steps → **ba-start flow**

**For presale flow interrupted steps:**
Print the interrupted step summary, then **immediately invoke the presale step** without waiting:

```text
⚠ Interrupted presale step detected

Step:        {step}
Command:     {command}
Started:     {started}
Progress:    {progress}   ← omit if empty
Resume hint: {resume_hint}   ← omit if empty

Resuming /ba-presale {step}...
```

Map `step` value to presale subcommand:
- `bootstrap` → `/ba-presale` (bare, re-runs bootstrap + domain-study chain)
- `domain-study` → `/ba-presale` (bare, re-runs from domain-study)
- `clarify` → `/ba-presale clarify`
- `build` → `/ba-presale build`
- `handoff` → `/ba-presale handoff`

Load and execute the corresponding presale step file. Pass `resume_hint` as context if present.

**For ba-start flow interrupted steps:**
Print the interrupted step summary and present options — do NOT auto-resume, because ba-start steps may have partially written artifacts that need user judgment:

```text
⚠ Interrupted step detected

Step:        {step}
Command:     {command}
Started:     {started}
Progress:    {progress}   ← omit if empty
Resume hint: {resume_hint}   ← omit if empty

Options:
  (a) Resume — re-run the same command (agent will use resume_hint to skip completed sub-steps)
  (b) Skip — treat as incomplete and proceed to the next step
  (c) Mark done — artifact was actually completed; update checkpoint and re-run /ba-next
```

Wait for user choice before proceeding.

If neither checkpoint file exists or both are `status: completed`, continue to `inspect_artifacts`.
</step>

<step name="inspect_artifacts">
Using the snapshot manifest or stat-only checks, determine which of these exist:
- intake
- plan
- options index
- option files
- comparison file
- backbone
- frd
- user stories
- srs
- wireframe-input
- wireframe-map
- wireframe-state
- packaged FRD/SRS HTML

When the snapshot is current, use its `artifacts` list directly.
When the snapshot is absent or degraded, use filesystem stat only — do not open files.
Read the backbone gate section only when the snapshot is absent and gate ambiguity cannot be
resolved from artifact presence alone.
</step>

<step name="determine_next_step">
Apply the first matching rule:

1. no intake -> next step `ba-start intake`
2. intake exists and `paths.plan` says options are `recommended` or `in-progress` -> `ba-start options --slug <slug>`
3. intake exists and `paths.plan` is missing, invalid, or says `completed` without `selected option` -> `ba-start status --slug <slug>`
4. intake exists, `paths.plan` says options are `not-needed`, and no backbone -> `ba-start backbone --slug <slug>`
5. intake exists, `paths.plan` says options are `skipped`, or `completed` with `selected option` recorded in `paths.plan`, and no backbone -> `ba-start backbone --slug <slug>`
6. backbone exists and FRD is explicitly required but missing -> `ba-start frd --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
7. backbone exists but user stories are missing -> `ba-start stories --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
8. SRS is required and missing -> `ba-start srs --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
9. wireframe-input exists and wireframe-state is missing while wireframe handoff is required -> `ba-start wireframes --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
10. final markdown exists but required packaged HTML is missing -> `ba-start package --slug <slug>`
11. everything required already exists -> `ba-start status --slug <slug>`

When FRD/SRS/wireframe-handoff gates are unclear, explain the uncertainty and recommend
`ba-start status --slug <slug>` instead of guessing.
</step>

<step name="display">
Print a compact, deterministic block:

```text
BA Next

Project: {slug}
Date set: {date}
Snapshot: current | degraded | absent
Project Home: {PROJECT-HOME.md exists/missing}
Next command: /ba-start ...
BA-facing next step: ...
Reason: ...
```

Do not mutate artifacts during this command.
