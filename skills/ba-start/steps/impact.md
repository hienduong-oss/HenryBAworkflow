# BA Start Step - Impact

This step requires:

- `core/contract.yaml`
- `core/contract-behavior.md`

## Memory Read Scope

- **Must read:** `core/contract.yaml`, `core/contract-behavior.md`, `paths.intake`, `paths.backbone`
- **May read:** `paths.project_memory`, `paths.memory_index`, `paths.memory_hot_*`, selected `warm/` shard; downstream artifacts (frd, stories, srs, wireframes); `log.md` only when user requests audit
- **Must NOT read:** `cold/` (unless escalated)
- **Note:** `impact` is the only broad-read command.

## Promotion Guidance

After impact analysis and user approval of a rerun path:
1. Document which memory shards/vocabulary/decisions need updating.
2. Prepare file-back record outline using `templates/project-memory-fileback-record-template.md`.
3. Pass outline to user for review before mutating step executes.

## Scope

Run the change-impact triage path only. **Do not mutate artifacts by default.**

Impact analysis is read-only. Approved write mode is opt-in:
- User must explicitly approve before any artifact is written.
- When approved, impact may write: `paths.change_request`, `paths.impact_report`, and update `paths.shared_staleness`.
- `core/contract.yaml` records `impact.mutable=false` and `outputs=[]` for the default analysis-only mode.
- Approved write mode uses `change_request` and `impact_report` templates and appends stale artifact records to `paths.shared_staleness`.

## Prerequisites

- Resolve slug, date, and module scope through the shared contract.
- Require change input: direct file path or pasted change text.
- Require `paths.intake`. If missing, print exact path and stop.
- Read `paths.backbone` when it exists.
- Read module-scoped downstream artifacts only when relevant to suspected impact:
  `paths.frd`, `paths.userstories_index`, `paths.usecases_index`, `paths.ascii_screen_index`, `paths.srs_spec`, `paths.srs_flows`, `paths.srs_states`, `paths.srs_erd`, `paths.srs`, `paths.screen_field_contract`, `paths.tool_lane_state`, `paths.make_guidelines`, `paths.make_prompt_pack`, `paths.prototype_conformance_checklist`, `paths.prototype_conformance_report`, `paths.design_doc`, `paths.plan`, `paths.shared_traceability`, `paths.shared_staleness`, `paths.shared_definitions`

## Decision Rules

Treat the current source of truth in this order:

1. `backbone`
2. otherwise `intake`

Reverse lane detection: if `paths.reverse_baseline_lock` exists, apply reverse classification before forward-lifecycle rules.

Classify the change into one or more buckets:

Standard: `wording-only`, `clarification-only`, `backbone-change`, `scope-lock-change`, `ui-impact`

Reverse lane (when reverse_baseline_lock exists):
- `as_built_drift` — code exists but is undocumented or contradicts baseline
- `future_state_request` — desired behavior not yet in code
- `mixed_change` — both; must be split before promotion
- `unverifiable_in_v1` — cannot classify from source alone; do not guess

Never merge `as_built_drift` and `future_state_request` into one rerun recommendation.

Impact anchors:

- intake: business problem, goals, out-of-scope, success metrics
- backbone: scope lock summary, feature map, FR/NFR backbone, actors, portal matrix, story map, UI coverage, artifact gates
- FRD: feature wording, workflows, business rules, integration points
- user stories: `userstories/us-*.md` story intent and acceptance criteria
- SRS source set: `usecases/uc-*.md` flows, `ascii-screen/*.md` screen behavior, `srs/spec.md` FR/NFR/rules, `srs/flows.md` module flows, `srs/states.md` state registry, `srs/erd.md` data model
- shared artifacts: `shared/traceability.md`, `shared/staleness.md`, `shared/definitions.md`
- UI artifacts: normalized screen-field contract, runtime `DESIGN.md` assumptions, tool-lane state, prompt/control pack, and review checklist/report

## Routing Rules

- Goals, out-of-scope, success metrics, scope decisions → route to `intake` first.
- Feature scope, FR/NFR intent, actors, acceptance-criteria intent, portal ownership, global nav schema → route to `backbone` first.
- Story wording or testable acceptance detail within existing backbone intent → route to `stories` (outputs `userstories/`).
- Use case flow, validation behavior, error states, screen behavior within existing backbone+story intent → route to `srs` (outputs `usecases/`, `ascii-screen/`, `srs/`).
- Screen inventory, state variants, navigation, overlays, field interactions → mark `ui-impact`; rerun `srs` after upstream rerun.
- Shared definitions or traceability gaps → route to `srs` rerun; do not update `shared/definitions.md` or `shared/traceability.md` directly without user approval.
- Never recommend `package` as first remediation step after a real requirement change.

Reverse lane routing (when reverse_baseline_lock exists):
- `as_built_drift` → `ba-start reverse promote --slug <slug> --evidence-ids <ids>`
- `future_state_request` → forward lifecycle (backbone / stories / srs)
- `mixed_change` → `ba-start reverse impact --slug <slug> --evidence-ids <ids>` to split first
- `unverifiable_in_v1` → surface to user; do not guess lane

## Output

Print: project/date, change type, source of truth, affected nodes, stale artifacts, read escalation, recommended path, exact commands, and focused questions only.

```text
Impact Delta

affected_node_ids: [scope | actor | FR/NFR | story | UC | SCR | rule | message IDs]
owner_artifact: [intake | backbone | stories | srs | wireframe artifacts | reverse_evidence_ledger]
stale_artifacts: [indexes or artifacts that must be refreshed by the rerun]
read_escalation: [none | READ_ESCALATION: impact read {path} due to {reason}]
reverse_lane: [absent | as_built_drift | future_state_request | mixed_change | unverifiable_in_v1]
guardrail_code: [none | reverse hard-guardrail code]
```

Rules:
- Map change to `affected_node_ids` before opening broad downstream context.
- Use `owner_artifact` to choose the smallest rerun path.
- Include index files in `stale_artifacts` when a CR can invalidate backbone_index, userstories_index, usecases_index, ascii_screen_index, srs_compile_receipt, shared_traceability, shared_staleness, screen_field_contract, tool_lane_state, make_guidelines, make_prompt_pack, prototype_conformance_checklist, or prototype_conformance_report.
- When stale artifacts are identified, recommend updating `paths.shared_staleness` with the stale artifact list and refresh commands. In approved write mode only, write the update directly.
- If CR cannot be mapped to a node, emit `read_escalation` and ask focused questions.
- When `reverse_lane` is not `absent`, print the exact reverse lane command before forward lifecycle commands.
- When a reverse hard guardrail is the blocker, set `guardrail_code` before any forward lifecycle command.
- Never omit `reverse_lane` field when `reverse_baseline_lock` exists.
