## Lifecycle Notes

- **Active / current:** `stale_status: current`, `validated_at` is set, `invalidated_at` is blank.
- **Stale:** source artifact was mutated after `validated_at`; set `stale_status: stale`. Downstream steps must not trust a stale index for routing.
- **Unknown:** index was just generated but not yet validated; producer must leave `stale_status: unknown` and run `validate-index-quality` before any downstream step treats it as current.
- **Invalidation trigger:** any mutation to the source artifact (backbone, stories, srs) invalidates the corresponding index receipt. A new validation run is required before the index can be used for routing.
- **Self-certification ban:** the producer step must never promote `stale_status` from `unknown` to `current`. Only the validator script or runtime validator may do so.
