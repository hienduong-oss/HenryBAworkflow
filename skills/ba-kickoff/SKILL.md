# BA Kickoff

Use this skill when you have raw requirements input (a file or pasted text) and need to bootstrap a full BA engagement. This is the single entry point that routes work across discovery, stakeholders, requirements, wireframes, process maps, and compliance.

## Inputs

- A file path to a requirements source (PDF, markdown, text, image, or Word), **or** pasted text directly
- Optional: known project name, requester, timeline constraints

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Accept Input

Ask the BA to provide one of:
- A file path (PDF, MD, TXT, image, DOCX)
- Pasted text containing requirements or business context

**File reading approach:**
- **PDF**: Use `Read` tool (native PDF support)
- **Markdown / text**: Use `Read` tool directly
- **Images** (screenshots, whiteboard photos): Use `Read` tool (multimodal vision) or delegate to `ai-multimodal` skill for detailed extraction
- **Word (.docx)**: Use `ai-multimodal` skill or ask the BA to export as PDF/MD first

### Step 2 — Parse and Normalize

Read the source material and extract content into the [intake-form-template.md](../../templates/intake-form-template.md) structure:
- Project name, date, requester
- Business context (problem, goals, stakeholders mentioned)
- Raw requirements (extracted verbatim)
- Screens / UI mentioned
- Processes / workflows mentioned
- Constraints, assumptions, compliance needs
- Open questions identified during parsing
- Source file reference and parsing notes

Save the completed intake form to `plans/reports/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`.

### Step 3 — Gap Analysis

Review the normalized intake against a BA completeness checklist:
- Are stakeholders identified with roles and influence?
- Is there a clear problem statement and measurable goal?
- Are scope boundaries defined (in-scope vs. out-of-scope)?
- Are success criteria or KPIs stated?
- Are compliance or regulatory obligations mentioned?
- Are UI screens described enough to wireframe?
- Are processes described enough to map?

Flag each gap explicitly.

### Step 4 — Ask Clarifying Questions

Present the identified gaps to the BA as 3-8 targeted questions using `AskUserQuestion` or direct prompts. Focus on:
- Missing stakeholders or decision makers
- Ambiguous scope boundaries
- Unstated success criteria
- Regulatory or compliance context
- Priority and sequencing preferences

Incorporate the BA's answers back into the intake form.

### Step 5 — Generate Work Plan

Based on the normalized intake and BA answers, produce a scoped BA work plan covering:

**Document selection** — which artifacts to produce:

| Condition | Deliverable | Skill | Template |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Formal governance or vendor contract | BRD | `ba-requirements` | `brd-template.md` |
| Detailed functional spec needed | FRD | `ba-requirements` | `frd-template.md` |
| System spec with screens and test cases | SRS | `ba-requirements` | `srs-template.md` |
| Agile team needs stories | User stories | `ba-user-stories` | `user-story-template.md` |
| Stakeholders need mapping | Stakeholder register + RACI | `ba-stakeholder` | `stakeholder-register-template.md`, `raci-template.md` |
| Processes need documentation | Process maps | `ba-process-mapping` | `process-map-template.md` |
| Regulatory exposure exists | Compliance map | `ba-compliance` | — |
| Gaps between current and target state | Gap analysis | `ba-gap-analysis` | `gap-analysis-template.md` |
| UI screens mentioned | Wireframes | Pencil MCP tools | `designs/{slug}/` |
| Strategic framing needed | SWOT | `ba-swot` | `swot-template.md` |
| Financial justification needed | Cost-benefit | `ba-cost-benefit` | `feasibility-template.md` |

**SRS default routing** — The document selection table above lists SRS as conditional on "system spec with screens and test cases." The following broader triggers **supersede** that row and make SRS a default deliverable alongside FRD when the intake contains **any** of:
- UI screens or screen descriptions
- System-level interactions (APIs, integrations, data flows)
- Mobile or web application scope
- Test case or acceptance testing expectations

When SRS is included, invoke `ba-requirements` with explicit instruction to produce SRS using `srs-template.md` **in addition to** FRD. The SRS adds use case specifications, screen descriptions, non-functional requirements, data flow diagrams, and test cases that FRD does not cover.

**Skill chain** — recommended execution order, e.g.:
`ba-discovery` -> `ba-stakeholder` -> `ba-requirements` (FRD + SRS) -> `ba-user-stories` -> `ba-process-mapping` -> `ba-compliance`

**Agent delegation** — which agent roles to involve:

| Agent | When |
| --- | --- |
| `stakeholder-analyst` | Stakeholders need mapping or engagement planning |
| `requirements-engineer` | Formal requirements capture |
| `process-mapper` | Process flows need modeling |
| `ba-researcher` | Domain research or market context needed |
| `compliance-auditor` | Regulatory or governance checks required |
| `ba-documentation-manager` | Final packaging and quality review |

**Effort estimate** — light / medium / heavy per deliverable.

### Step 6 — Save Outputs

- Intake form: `plans/reports/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`
- Work plan: `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md`

### Step 7 — Execute Skill Chain

After the work plan is saved and approved, execute the skill chain in order. For each skill invocation, pass the intake form and work plan as context.

When SRS is in the deliverable list:
1. Invoke `ba-requirements` for FRD first (produces functional requirements by epic)
2. Invoke `ba-requirements` for SRS second, using the FRD output as input — this adds use cases, screen descriptions, NFRs, data flows, and test cases
3. If SRS contains screen descriptions, `ba-requirements` Phase 2 triggers automatic wireframe generation via Pencil MCP (unless user explicitly skips)

**FRD naming:** `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md` (or split by epic: `frd-{date}-{slug}-epics-1-to-N.md`)
**SRS naming:** `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`

## Deliverables

- Normalized intake form (from template)
- Gap analysis summary
- Scoped BA work plan with skill chain, agent routing, and deliverable list
- SRS document (default when UI screens or system interactions are present)

## Templates

- Use [intake-form-template.md](../../templates/intake-form-template.md)

## Related Skills

- `ba-discovery`
- `ba-stakeholder`
- `ba-requirements`
- `ba-user-stories`
- `ba-process-mapping`
- `ba-compliance`
- `ba-gap-analysis`
- `ba-feasibility`
- `ba-cost-benefit`
- `ba-swot`

## Quality Check

- Intake form has no blank required sections
- Every gap is either resolved or listed as an open question
- Work plan names specific skills, templates, and agents
- Skill chain order respects dependencies (discovery before requirements, requirements before compliance)
- Deliverable list matches the complexity and governance needs of the initiative
- SRS is included when intake contains UI screens, system interactions, or mobile/web app scope
- SRS references correct template (`srs-template.md`) and follows `ba-requirements` Phase 2 for wireframe generation (unless user explicitly skips)
