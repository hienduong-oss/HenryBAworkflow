## Coverage Checks

- Every primary screen in the input pack has a manual handoff row
- Every required supporting state inferred during preparation is documented
- Every primary screen has a clear `Portal ID`
- Every screen group carries a portal and navigation-schema snapshot
- Every screen with visible global navigation has explicit active-state evidence
- Every hidden-navigation exception is documented with a reason
- Every final SRS screen section has a clear place for user-supplied wireframe evidence
- Screen IDs remain stable between the SRS and the manual wireframe handoff pack
- Any user-supplied mockup must remain aligned with the approved `DESIGN.md`
