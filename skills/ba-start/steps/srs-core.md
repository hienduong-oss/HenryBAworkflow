# BA Start Step - SRS Core

## Checkpoint

Write `plans/{slug}-{date}/_checkpoint.md` as the **first action** before reading any artifact:
```
step: srs-core
status: running
command: <exact invoked command>
started: <ISO timestamp>
updated: <ISO timestamp>
progress: ""
last_write: ""
resume_hint: ""
```
After each incremental screen/section write, update `progress` (e.g., "SCR-03/8 done"), `last_write`, and `resume_hint`.
On complete, update `status: completed` and `updated`.

This step requires:

- `core/contract.yaml`
- `core/contract-behavior.md`
- `core/behavior/srs.md`

## Step 8 — Produce SRS Core, Use Cases, and Screen Contract Plus

Produce only the slices justified by mode and artifact gates. Use the accepted scope from the resolved backbone and user stories; do not reopen discovery after the user has approved SRS authoring.

Mode defaults:

- `lite`: run SRS only when explicitly requested.
- `hybrid`: cover complex flows, risky validations, integrations, and delivery-critical screens.
- `formal`: emit the full SRS set.

Upstream context:

- matching intake summary
- backbone features, gates, and risks
- user stories with acceptance criteria
- FRD features and business rules when FRD exists or mode requires it

### Group A - Core

Sections:

- Purpose and Scope
- Overall Description
- Functional Requirements table

Output: `paths.srs_group` with `group=a`

### Group B - Behavioral

Sections:

- Use Case Specifications

Output: `paths.srs_group` with `group=b`

Consistency rules:

- each use case links to user stories and screens
- actor actions use the same terminology as user stories and FRD

### Group C - Screen Contract Plus

Sections:

- Screen Contract Plus
- Screen Inventory

Output: `paths.srs_group` with `group=c`

Before Group C for UI-backed screens, apply the navigation schema gate in `core/behavior/srs.md`. If `paths.design_doc` is missing or unresolved, run Step 8.2 from `srs-wireframes.md` first.

After Group C, run:

```text
python3 scripts/validate-navigation-consistency.py --design {paths.design_doc} --screen-contract {paths.srs_group group=c}
```

Fix blocking navigation validator findings before continuing.

## Step 8.1 - Build Wireframe Constraint Pack

After Groups B and C are complete, assemble `paths.wireframe_input` before any manual design work starts.

Source inputs:

- `paths.srs_group` with `group=b`
- `paths.srs_group` with `group=c`
- relevant portal snapshot from `paths.backbone`
- relevant FRD and user-story excerpts for traceability

The pack must include artifact set information, target design document path, use case excerpts, Screen Contract Plus, Screen Inventory, portal/navigation snapshots, active-menu evidence requirements, navigation exceptions, manual-design constraints, approved design snapshot or gaps, grouping/handoff plan, and stop conditions.
