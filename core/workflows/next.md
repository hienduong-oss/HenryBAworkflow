<purpose>
Detect the next logical BA step from the current BA-kit artifact set.

This command is the BA equivalent of a lightweight state machine. It reads the current project
artifacts and recommends the next exact command.  It must stay deterministic and compact — no
broad artifact reads, no content parsing beyond what is needed to classify state.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read `contract.yaml` and `contract-behavior.md` only.  Do not read full backbone, stories, or SRS
to compute the next step.
</required_reading>

<discovery_strategy>
Snapshot-first, then stat-only fallback:

1. Check for `plans/{slug}-{date}/02_backbone/package-snapshot.md`.
   - If present and `snapshot_state: current`, derive artifact existence from its `artifacts` list.
   - If absent or `snapshot_state: degraded`, fall back to filesystem stat checks only.
2. Read `paths.plan` header (first 30 lines) to detect options status and selected option.
3. Do not read backbone content, stories content, or SRS content to determine the next step.
4. Emit `READ_ESCALATION: next read {path} due to {reason}` only when content is genuinely
   required to resolve an ambiguous gate (e.g., backbone gate section missing from snapshot).
</discovery_strategy>

<process>

<step name="resolve_project">
Resolve the target slug and dated set using the artifact contract.

Rules:
- prefer explicit `--slug`
- otherwise detect a single existing project set from exact BA-kit artifact patterns
- if ambiguous, stop and ask the user to choose
- when the next exact command would be module-scoped (`frd`, `stories`, or `srs`),
  resolve the module using the contract rules before emitting the command
- if multiple module directories exist, stop and ask instead of emitting an incomplete
  module-scoped command
</step>

<step name="check_checkpoint">
Before inspecting artifacts, read both checkpoint files for the resolved project:
- `/ba-start` checkpoint: `plans/{slug}-{date}/_checkpoint.md`
- `/ba-presale` checkpoint: `plans/{slug}-{date}/00_presale/_checkpoint.md`

If either checkpoint file exists and `status: running`:
- The previous session was interrupted mid-step.
- Determine the flow from the `step` field:
  - Presale steps (`bootstrap`, `domain-study`, `clarify`, `build`, `handoff`) → **presale flow**
  - All other steps → **ba-start flow**

**For presale flow interrupted steps:**
Print the interrupted step summary, then **immediately invoke the presale step** without waiting:

```text
⚠ Interrupted presale step detected

Step:        {step}
Command:     {command}
Started:     {started}
Progress:    {progress}   ← omit if empty
Resume hint: {resume_hint}   ← omit if empty

Resuming /ba-presale {step}...
```

Map `step` value to presale subcommand:
- `bootstrap` → `/ba-presale` (bare, re-runs bootstrap + domain-study chain)
- `domain-study` → `/ba-presale` (bare, re-runs from domain-study)
- `clarify` → `/ba-presale clarify`
- `build` → `/ba-presale build`
- `handoff` → `/ba-presale handoff`

Load and execute the corresponding presale step file. Pass `resume_hint` as context if present.

**For ba-start flow interrupted steps:**
Print the interrupted step summary and present options — do NOT auto-resume, because ba-start steps may have partially written artifacts that need user judgment:

```text
⚠ Interrupted step detected

Step:        {step}
Command:     {command}
Started:     {started}
Progress:    {progress}   ← omit if empty
Resume hint: {resume_hint}   ← omit if empty

Options:
  (a) Resume — re-run the same command (agent will use resume_hint to skip completed sub-steps)
  (b) Skip — treat as incomplete and proceed to the next step
  (c) Mark done — artifact was actually completed; update checkpoint and re-run /ba-next
```

Wait for user choice before proceeding.

If neither checkpoint file exists or both are `status: completed`, continue to `inspect_artifacts`.
</step>

<step name="inspect_artifacts">
Using the snapshot manifest or stat-only checks, determine which of these exist:
- intake
- plan
- options index
- option files
- comparison file
- backbone
- frd
- user stories
- srs
- srs-index
- screens directory
- usecases directory
- data directory
- flows directory
- srs-compile-receipt
- packaged FRD/SRS HTML
- reverse_baseline_lock (stat only: `plans/{slug}-{date}/00_reverse/reverse-baseline-lock.json`)
- reverse_index (stat only: `plans/{slug}-{date}/00_reverse/reverse-index.md`)
- reverse_evidence_ledger (stat only: `plans/{slug}-{date}/00_reverse/reverse-evidence-ledger.md`)
- reverse_drift_state (stat only: `plans/{slug}-{date}/00_reverse/reverse-drift-state.json`)

When the snapshot is current, use its `artifacts` list directly.
When the snapshot is absent or degraded, use filesystem stat only — do not open files.
Read the backbone gate section only when the snapshot is absent and gate ambiguity cannot be
resolved from artifact presence alone.
Do not open reverse lane files to determine next step — stat checks only.
</step>

<step name="determine_next_step">
Apply the first matching rule:

1. no intake -> next step `ba-start intake`
   Hint (display only, does not change the recommended command): "Chưa có tài liệu yêu cầu? Thử `/brainstorm <ý tưởng>` trước để clarify idea thành structured input cho intake."
2. intake exists and `paths.plan` says options are `recommended` or `in-progress` -> `ba-start options --slug <slug>`
3. intake exists and `paths.plan` is missing, invalid, or says `completed` without `selected option` -> `ba-start status --slug <slug>`
4. intake exists, `paths.plan` says options are `not-needed`, and no backbone -> `ba-start backbone --slug <slug>`
5. intake exists, `paths.plan` says options are `skipped`, or `completed` with `selected option` recorded in `paths.plan`, and no backbone -> `ba-start backbone --slug <slug>`
6. backbone exists and FRD is explicitly required but missing -> `ba-start frd --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
7. backbone exists but `userstories/index.md` is missing -> `ba-start stories --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
8. SRS is required and missing -> `ba-start srs --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
9. SRS exists but `usecases/index.md` or `ascii-screen/index.md` is missing -> `ba-start srs --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
10. SRS exists but canon sources (`ascii-screen/`, `usecases/`, optional `srs/flows.md`, optional `srs/erd.md`) are absent for a UI-backed module -> `ba-start srs --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
11. canon sources exist but `srs-compile-receipt.json` is missing or older than canon source files -> `ba-start srs --slug <slug> --module <module_slug>`
12. final markdown exists but required packaged HTML is missing -> `ba-start package --slug <slug>`
13. everything required already exists -> `ba-start status --slug <slug>`

Reverse lane rules (apply before forward rules whenever reverse_baseline_lock exists):

R0. reverse_baseline_lock exists and reverse_index is absent -> `ba-start reverse --slug <slug>`
    Reason: reverse lane is incomplete before index creation; do not fall through to forward lifecycle.
R1. reverse_baseline_lock exists but reverse_evidence_ledger is absent -> `ba-start reverse impact --slug <slug>`
    Reason: baseline scan complete but evidence not yet classified.
R2. reverse_evidence_ledger exists and reverse_drift_state is absent -> `ba-start reverse status --slug <slug>`
    Reason: drift state or classification summary is not yet safe to infer from stat-only reads.
R3. reverse_evidence_ledger exists and reverse_drift_state exists -> `ba-start reverse status --slug <slug>`
    Reason: do not infer unclassified counts, promoted state, or evidence IDs from content during `next`.
R4. Only after `ba-start reverse status` confirms the reverse lane is complete may `next` continue to forward lifecycle rules 1–11.

Reverse lane guard:
- Never auto-pick a reverse lane step when focus_selection is missing from baseline lock.
- If reverse_baseline_lock exists but focus_selection is empty or absent, emit:
  `ba-start reverse --slug <slug>` with reason "focus_selection missing — re-run baseline scan to select focus areas."
  block_code: `FOCUS_SELECTION_REQUIRED`
- If reverse lane status is stale, drifted, or blocked, surface the reverse guardrail code from the active status path instead of guessing a forward step.
- Reverse lane rules (R0–R4) take priority over forward rules (1–11) whenever reverse_baseline_lock exists and reverse completion is not explicitly confirmed.

When FRD/SRS/canon/compile gates are unclear, explain the uncertainty and recommend
`ba-start status --slug <slug>` instead of guessing.
</step>

<step name="display">
Print a compact, deterministic block:

```text
BA Next

Project: {slug}
Date set: {date}
Snapshot: current | degraded | absent
Project Home: {PROJECT-HOME.md exists/missing}
Reverse lane: active | complete | absent
Next command: /ba-start ...
BA-facing next step: ...
Hint: {only when rule 1 matched — "Chưa có requirements? Thử /brainstorm <ý tưởng> trước."}
Reason: ...

Do not mutate artifacts during this command.
