# BA Start

Use this skill to run an end-to-end business analysis engagement from raw input to packaged deliverables. This remains the single BA-kit skill, but it now supports step-level subcommands for resumable and partial runs.

## Invocation

```text
/ba-start
/ba-start intake <file>
/ba-start intake
/ba-start frd --slug <slug>
/ba-start stories --slug <slug>
/ba-start srs --slug <slug>
/ba-start wireframes --slug <slug>
/ba-start package --slug <slug>
/ba-start status --slug <slug>
```

## Priority Contract

Read this section first. Only continue to the detailed step sections when you need the exact production instructions for the selected command.

### Fast execution order

1. Parse `ARGUMENTS` before doing any work.
2. Resolve the subcommand: `intake`, `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`, or `status`.
3. Apply output defaults:
   - write BA deliverables in Vietnamese unless the user explicitly requests English
   - use `YYMMDD-HHmm` as the artifact-set `{date}` token
   - default UI-backed wireframes to Shadcn UI unless the user explicitly overrides it
4. Resolve the target scope with exact matching only:
   - explicit `--slug <slug>` first
   - otherwise use a single detected slug only
   - if multiple slugs exist, stop and ask
   - if multiple dated sets exist for the slug, stop and ask
5. Check prerequisites for the chosen command.
6. If any prerequisite is missing, print the missing exact path, print the exact prior subcommand to run, and stop.
7. Before mutating `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, or `package`, if the target output already exists, ask whether to overwrite or stop.

### Command routing summary

| Command | Runs | Must read first | Produces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| no subcommand | Full workflow | raw input | intake, FRD, stories, SRS, wireframes, package |
| `intake` | Steps 1-5 | raw input | intake + plan |
| `frd` | Step 6 | intake | FRD + FRD HTML |
| `stories` | Step 7 | FRD | user stories |
| `srs` | Steps 8-11 | FRD + user stories | grouped SRS + merged SRS + wireframes |
| `wireframes` | Step 9 only | group-c SRS or merged SRS with Screen Contract Lite | `.pen`, exports, wireframe-state |
| `package` | Step 12 only | merged SRS + non-missing wireframe-state | SRS HTML + delivery summary |
| `status` | inspection only | none | checklist output |

### Non-negotiable stop conditions

- Never silently choose a slug or dated set by mtime.
- Never use broad `*-{slug}*` matching when exact artifact patterns are available.
- `wireframes` is read-only on upstream BA artifacts. It may regenerate only design outputs and the wireframe-state marker.
- `package` must block only when wireframe state is `missing`.
- If no wireframe-state marker exists, treat it as `not-applicable` only when the SRS set has no UI-backed screens or Screen Contract Lite section. Otherwise treat it as `missing`.

## Shared Routing And State Rules

### Core operating defaults

- Write BA deliverables in Vietnamese by default unless the user explicitly requests English.
- Treat the artifact-set `{date}` token as `YYMMDD-HHmm` consistently across report filenames and `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md`.
- For UI-backed scope, use Shadcn UI as the default wireframe and UI-handoff design-system baseline unless the user explicitly overrides it.

### Argument parsing

Parse `ARGUMENTS` before doing any work.

1. Read tokens left to right.
2. Extract `--slug <slug>` if present.
3. The first remaining token that matches one of these values is the subcommand:
   - `intake`
   - `frd`
   - `stories`
   - `srs`
   - `wireframes`
   - `package`
   - `status`
4. If there is no subcommand:
   - run the full workflow
   - if one free argument remains, treat it as the initial file path or pasted-input hint for Step 1
5. For `intake`, one free argument may be a direct file path.
6. For `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`, and `status`, reject unexpected free arguments, print the supported syntax, and stop.
7. If the first token looks like an unknown subcommand, print the supported subcommand list and stop.

### Routing rules

- No subcommand means full workflow. Keep the existing lifecycle order intact.
- `intake` runs Steps 1-5 only.
- `frd` runs Step 6 only.
- `stories` runs Step 7 only.
- `srs` runs Steps 8-11 and includes wireframes by default.
- `wireframes` runs Step 9 only as a re-run path from existing screen-contract artifacts.
- `package` runs Step 12 only.
- `status` inspects current artifacts and prints a checklist with dates.

### Slug resolution

Subcommands that operate on an existing project must resolve the target project slug in this order:

1. Use the explicit `--slug <slug>` value when provided.
2. Otherwise inspect `plans/reports/` for exact BA-kit artifact patterns and collect unique candidate slugs.
3. If exactly one candidate slug exists, use it.
4. If multiple candidate slugs exist, print the candidate list, ask the user to choose a slug or rerun with `--slug`, and stop.

For mutating subcommands (`frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`), never silently choose a slug by mtime.

### Dated set resolution

After resolving the slug, resolve the target dated artifact set.

1. Inspect exact filenames for the selected slug:
   - `plans/reports/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`
   - `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/reports/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md`
   - `plans/reports/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md`
   - `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md`
2. Build candidate `{date}` sets from exact filename matches only.
3. If exactly one dated set exists for the slug, use it.
4. If multiple dated sets exist for that slug and the command is `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, `package`, or `status`, print the available dates, ask the user to choose the target dated set, and stop until the user chooses.
5. Never silently select the latest dated set by mtime.

### Exact artifact matching

Use exact filename patterns, not broad `*-{slug}*` matching. Print the specific missing artifact path when a prerequisite check fails.

### Prerequisite reference

| Command | Requires | Produces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intake` | Raw input (file or pasted text) | `plans/reports/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`, `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md` |
| `frd` | `plans/reports/intake-{slug}-{date}.md` | `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`, `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.html` |
| `stories` | `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md` | `plans/reports/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md` |
| `srs` | `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`, `plans/reports/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md` | `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md` and any supporting `srs-{date}-{slug}-group-*.md` files |
| `wireframes` | `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md` or merged `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md` with Screen Contract Lite already assembled | `designs/{slug}/*.pen`, `designs/{slug}/exports/**`, `plans/reports/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md` |
| `package` | `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`; wireframes may be completed, skipped, or not-applicable | `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.html`, delivery summary |
| `status` | None | Checklist output only |

### Missing prerequisite behavior

If a required artifact is missing:

1. Print the missing exact path.
2. Print the exact subcommand to run first.
3. Stop. Do not chain forward automatically.

### Overwrite handling

Before mutating `frd`, `stories`, `srs`, `wireframes`, or `package`:

1. Check whether the target artifact already exists.
2. If it exists, print the path and ask whether to overwrite or stop.
3. If the user declines or does not approve, stop without mutating anything.

### Wireframe state model

Persist an explicit wireframe-state marker after every Step 9 run at:

`plans/reports/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md`

Use this structure:

```md
# Wireframe State

- Slug: {slug}
- Date: {date}
- State: completed | skipped | not-applicable | missing
- Source: plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md OR plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md
- Artifacts:
  - designs/{slug}/{artifact-name}.pen
- Exports:
  - designs/{slug}/exports/{artifact-name}/SCR-xx-name.png
- Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
- Notes: short rationale
```

State meanings:

- `completed`: `.pen` artifacts and expected exports were generated.
- `skipped`: the user explicitly chose to skip wireframes in Step 9.
- `not-applicable`: the selected scope has no UI-backed screens or no Screen Contract Lite requirement.
- `missing`: wireframes are required for the selected SRS set but the artifacts are absent or the run failed before completion.

`package` must block only when the state is `missing`.

`status` must print the explicit wireframe state and the marker last-modified date. If no marker exists:

- treat the state as `not-applicable` only when the selected SRS set has no UI-backed screens or Screen Contract Lite section
- otherwise treat it as `missing`

## Full Workflow

When no subcommand is provided, run the complete lifecycle in order:

1. `intake`
2. `frd`
3. `stories`
4. `srs`
5. `package`

Preserve the current behavior of the full workflow: accept raw input, perform clarification, produce all downstream artifacts, generate wireframes before final screen descriptions, and finish with packaged HTML deliverables.

## Subcommand: intake

Run Steps 1-5 only.

### Prerequisites

- Requires raw input as a file path or pasted text.
- If no input argument is provided, prompt the user for either a file path or pasted text.
- `--slug <slug>` may override the derived project slug.

### Step 1 - Accept input

Ask the user to provide one of:

- A file path (PDF, MD, TXT, image, DOCX)
- Pasted text containing requirements or business context

File reading approach:

- PDF: use native PDF-capable reading tooling
- Markdown or text: read directly
- Images: use multimodal reading
- Word (`.docx`): use multimodal extraction or ask the user to export to PDF or Markdown first

### Step 2 - Parse and normalize

Read the source material and extract content into the [intake-form-template.md](../../templates/intake-form-template.md) structure:

- Project name, date, requester
- Business context (problem, goals, stakeholders mentioned)
- Raw requirements (extracted verbatim)
- Screens or UI mentioned
- Processes or workflows mentioned
- Constraints, assumptions, compliance needs
- Open questions identified during parsing

Save the completed intake form to `plans/reports/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`.

### Step 3 - Gap analysis

Review the normalized intake against a BA completeness checklist:

- Are stakeholders identified with roles and influence?
- Is there a clear problem statement and measurable goal?
- Are scope boundaries defined (in-scope vs out-of-scope)?
- Are success criteria or KPIs stated?
- Are compliance or regulatory obligations mentioned?
- Are UI screens described enough to wireframe?
- Are processes described enough to map?

Flag each gap explicitly.

### Step 4 - Ask clarifying questions

Present the identified gaps to the user as 3-8 targeted questions. Focus on:

- Output language
- Missing stakeholders or decision makers
- Ambiguous scope boundaries
- Unstated success criteria
- Regulatory or compliance context
- Priority and sequencing preferences

Incorporate the answers back into the intake form.

### Step 5 - Generate work plan

Based on the normalized intake, produce a scoped work plan covering:

#### Deliverable selection

| Condition | Deliverable | Template |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detailed functional spec needed | FRD | `frd-template.md` |
| Agile team needs stories | User stories | `user-story-template.md` |
| System spec with screens, use cases, or test cases | SRS | `srs-template.md` |
| UI screens mentioned | Wireframes | `designs/{slug}/` via Pencil MCP, grouped by flow or module with frame-level screen mapping |

SRS default routing: include SRS alongside FRD when the intake contains any of:

- UI screens or screen descriptions
- System-level interactions (APIs, integrations, data flows)
- Mobile or web application scope
- Test case or acceptance testing expectations

#### Agent delegation

| Agent | When |
| --- | --- |
| `requirements-engineer` | FRD, user stories, SRS production |
| `ui-ux-designer` | Pencil wireframe generation from SRS screens |
| `ba-documentation-manager` | Final packaging and quality review |
| `ba-researcher` | Domain research when external context is needed |

Execution order:

`Intake -> FRD -> User Stories -> SRS -> Wireframes -> Quality Review`

UI design system default: unless the user explicitly asks for another system, use Shadcn UI as the default component and layout baseline for wireframes and UI-oriented handoff artifacts.

Save the work plan to `plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md`.

## Subcommand: frd

Run Step 6 only.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require `plans/reports/intake-{slug}-{date}.md`.
- If the intake artifact is missing, print the exact missing path, tell the user to run `/ba-start intake`, and stop.
- Trust the user intent. Do not re-check whether the work plan selected FRD.

### Output

- `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`
- `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.html`

### Step 6 - Produce FRD

Produce the FRD using [frd-template.md](../../templates/frd-template.md):

- Functional overview
- User personas
- Feature list with MoSCoW priorities
- Workflows (Mermaid)
- Data requirements
- Business rules
- Integration points
- Acceptance criteria

Save to `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`.

Export FRD to HTML for rendered Mermaid workflows:

```bash
python scripts/md-to-html.py plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md
```

Output: `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.html`

## Subcommand: stories

Run Step 7 only.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`.
- If the FRD artifact is missing, print the exact missing path, tell the user to run `/ba-start frd --slug {slug}`, and stop.

### Output

- `plans/reports/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md`

### Step 7 - Produce user stories

Generate Agile user stories from the FRD feature list using [user-story-template.md](../../templates/user-story-template.md):

- Epic and feature breakdown
- User stories with acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- INVEST validation
- Story-to-screen alignment when UI exists

User stories with their acceptance criteria become the primary input for SRS, wireframes, and downstream artifacts. Every SRS functional requirement, use case, and screen description should trace back to one or more user stories.

Save to `plans/reports/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md`.

## Subcommand: srs

Run Steps 8-11 only. This path includes wireframes by default.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require:
  - `plans/reports/frd-{date}-{slug}.md`
  - `plans/reports/user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md`
- If a required artifact is missing, print the exact missing path, tell the user which subcommand to run first, and stop.

### Output

- `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-a.md`
- `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-b.md`
- `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md`
- `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-d.md`
- `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-e.md`
- `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-f.md`
- `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`
- Any wireframe artifacts and the wireframe-state marker produced during Step 9

### Step 8 - Produce SRS core, use cases, and Screen Contract Lite

SRS is the largest artifact. Produce it in dependency order so wireframes are generated before final screen descriptions are expanded.

Provide the relevant upstream context to the SRS production owner:

- Matching intake summary
- FRD features and business rules
- User stories with acceptance criteria

Sub-agent context management:

- Pass only relevant sections of upstream artifacts, not full documents.
- Group A receives: intake summary, FRD features and business rules, user stories.
- Group B receives: Group A FR table and user stories.
- Group C receives: Group B use cases and user stories.
- Group D receives: Group A FR table and FRD technical sections.
- Group E receives: Group B use cases, Group C screen contract, and wireframe mapping.
- Group F receives: FR IDs, UC IDs, SCR IDs, and the final group outputs.
- When a group would produce more than 15 use cases or 10 screens, split into sub-groups.

#### Group A - Core

Sections:

- Purpose and Scope
- Overall Description
- Functional Requirements table

Output: `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-a.md`

#### Group B - Behavioral

Sections:

- Use Case Specifications

Output: `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-b.md`

Consistency rules:

- Each use case links to user stories and screens.
- Actor actions use the same terminology as the user stories and FRD.

#### Group C - Screen Contract Lite

Sections:

- Screen Contract Lite
- Screen Inventory

Output: `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md`

Consistency rules:

- Each primary screen links to its use cases and user stories.
- Screen Contract Lite must define screen IDs, entry and exit conditions, key actions, and required states.
- Modal, dialog, drawer, and overlay screens with their own interaction logic are primary screens, not supporting states.

#### Group D - Technical

Sections:

- Non-functional requirements
- Data flow diagrams
- ERD
- API specifications
- Constraints

Output: `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-d.md`

### Step 9 - Generate wireframes from use cases and Screen Contract Lite

Run the Step 9 workflow exactly as defined in the `wireframes` subcommand below, but treat it as part of the SRS pipeline and keep the same `{date}` set.

### Step 10 - Produce final screen descriptions

After wireframes are generated, expand the full Screen Descriptions from:

- Use Case Specifications
- Screen Contract Lite
- Wireframe artifact and frame mapping
- Supporting frame inventory

Output: `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-e.md`

Screen field table format:

| Field Name | Field Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Field] | [Type] | Display: [...] / Behaviour: [...] / Validation: [...] |

The description column contains up to three rule categories as needed:

- Display Rules: visibility, defaults, read-only conditions, formatting
- Behaviour Rules: on-change actions, auto-fill, cascading, navigation triggers
- Validation Rules: required, format, range, cross-field, error messages

### Step 10.1 - Produce validation pack

Produce the validation and traceability pack from the completed SRS sections.

Sections:

- Test Cases
- Glossary
- Traceability cross-references

Output: `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-f.md`

### Step 11 - Assembly and quality review

After all groups complete:

1. Merge groups into a single SRS following `srs-template.md` section order.
2. Run a cross-artifact consistency check:
   - Every UC step maps to a screen field or action and vice versa.
   - Screen Contract Lite entries have matching wireframes and final screen descriptions.
   - UC actor actions use the same wording as screen User Actions.
   - UC system responses match screen Behaviour Rules.
   - UC alternate flows are reflected in screen Error or States.
   - Field names are identical between UC steps, screen field tables, and wireframe labels.
   - User story acceptance criteria are covered by UC postconditions and screen Validation Rules.
3. Resolve UC placeholder references in screens.
4. Resolve ID conflicts across namespaces.
5. Verify every SCR and UC traces back to user stories.
6. Save to `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`.
7. Delete group fragments only after the merged SRS is verified.

Execution order:

```text
Group A
  -> Group B
  -> Group D
Group B -> Group C
Group C -> Wireframes
Wireframes -> Group E
Group E -> Group F
Group F -> Assembly
```

Failure handling: if a grouped pass fails, retry once. If it still fails, complete that group inline.

## Subcommand: wireframes

Run Step 9 only. This path must be read-only on upstream artifacts and regenerate only design outputs plus the explicit wireframe-state marker.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Resolve the wireframe source in this order:
  1. `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}-group-c.md`
  2. `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md` only when Screen Contract Lite is already assembled there
- If neither source exists, print both expected paths, tell the user to run `/ba-start srs --slug {slug}`, and stop.

### Output

- `designs/{slug}/{artifact-name}.pen`
- `designs/{slug}/exports/{artifact-name}/SCR-xx-name.png`
- `plans/reports/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md`

### Step 9.1 - Extract screen contract

Parse the Use Case Specifications, Screen Contract Lite, and Screen Inventory to build a generation plan.

- Group related screens into one or more Pencil artifacts by flow, module, or journey.
- Treat modal, dialog, and drawer overlays with flow impact as primary screens.
- For each primary screen, derive required supporting frames from the documented states, validation rules, table or list behavior, and feedback surfaces.

### Step 9.2 - Ask for wireframe preference

Ask:

```text
The screen contract defines {N} primary screens. How should I generate wireframes?
- Generate all wireframes automatically
- Let me pick which screens
- Skip wireframes
```

If the user skips:

- persist `plans/reports/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md` with `State: skipped`
- stop without changing upstream artifacts

If the scope has no UI-backed screens:

- persist the marker with `State: not-applicable`
- stop

If wireframes are expected but generation fails before completion:

- persist the marker with `State: missing`
- stop and report the failure

### Step 9.3 - Generate Pencil wireframes

For each approved screen group:

1. Read the linked use cases and Screen Contract Lite entries.
2. Verify that the wireframe intent matches the same actions, flow steps, and required states.
3. Use `web-app` or `mobile-app` guidelines as appropriate.
4. Use Shadcn UI as the default design-system baseline unless the user explicitly overrides it.
5. Create or update one `.pen` artifact per approved screen group.
6. Create one frame per primary screen and one frame per required supporting state or view.
7. Validate screenshots against the Use Cases and Screen Contract Lite.
8. Save each artifact to `designs/{slug}/{artifact-name}.pen`.

### Step 9.4 - Export wireframes to PNG

Export each relevant primary frame to PNG for embedding in the final SRS HTML:

```text
designs/{slug}/exports/{artifact-name}/SCR-xx-name.png
```

After successful export:

- persist `plans/reports/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md` with `State: completed`
- list the artifact and export paths in the marker

## Subcommand: package

Run Step 12 only.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- Require `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md`.
- If the merged SRS is missing, print the exact path, tell the user to run `/ba-start srs --slug {slug}`, and stop.
- Read `plans/reports/wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md` when present.
- If the wireframe state is `missing`, print the marker path, tell the user to run `/ba-start wireframes --slug {slug}`, and stop.
- If the wireframe state is `completed`, `skipped`, or `not-applicable`, continue.

### Output

- `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.html`
- Delivery summary

### Step 12 - Package deliverables

Run a final packaging and quality pass:

- Verify all deliverables follow their templates.
- Check cross-references between FRD, user stories, and SRS.
- Verify user-story traceability: every SRS FR, UC, and SCR maps to at least one user story.
- Run a cross-artifact consistency audit:
  - UC actor actions match screen User Actions.
  - Screen Contract Lite entries match both the wireframes and the final screen descriptions.
  - UC system responses match screen Behaviour Rules.
  - Field names are identical across UC steps, screen field tables, and wireframes.
  - User story acceptance criteria are covered by UC postconditions and screen Validation Rules.
  - FRD features are fully covered by user stories and SRS requirements.
- Validate naming conventions and file structure.
- Flag broken links or missing sections.
- Produce a delivery summary.

### Step 12.1 - Generate unified SRS HTML with embedded wireframes

Convert the merged SRS markdown to HTML with wireframe images embedded inline:

```bash
python scripts/md-to-html.py plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.md
```

Output: `plans/reports/srs-{date}-{slug}.html`

The final HTML should present:

- Use Case Specifications
- Wireframe images for primary screens when present
- Final Screen Descriptions
- Remaining SRS sections needed for traceability and review

### Step 12.2 - Final output structure

```text
plans/
  reports/
    intake-{slug}-{date}.md
    frd-{date}-{slug}.md
    frd-{date}-{slug}.html
    user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md
    srs-{date}-{slug}.md
    srs-{date}-{slug}.html
    wireframe-state-{date}-{slug}.md
  {date}-{slug}/
    plan.md
designs/
  {slug}/
    auth-flow.pen
    checkout.pen
    exports/
      auth-flow/
        SCR-01-login.png
        SCR-02-otp.png
      checkout/
        SCR-05-review-order.png
```

The HTML files are the primary stakeholder deliverables. The Markdown files remain the editable BA sources.

## Subcommand: status

Inspect the selected project set and print a checklist with artifact name, exists or missing status, and last-modified date.

### Prerequisites

- Resolve the slug and dated set using the shared rules.
- If slug or dated set resolution is ambiguous, print the choices and stop until the user selects one.

### Output format

Print a checklist like this:

```text
Project: {slug}
Date set: {date}

- [x] intake-{slug}-{date}.md — 2026-03-26
- [x] plans/{date}-{slug}/plan.md — 2026-03-26
- [x] frd-{date}-{slug}.md — 2026-03-26
- [x] frd-{date}-{slug}.html — 2026-03-26
- [ ] user-stories-{date}-{slug}.md — missing
- [ ] srs-{date}-{slug}.md — missing
- [!] wireframes — skipped — 2026-03-26
```

Status rules:

- For regular artifacts, print `exists` or `missing` with the last-modified date when present.
- For wireframes, print the explicit wireframe state (`completed`, `skipped`, `not-applicable`, or `missing`) plus the marker date.
- When wireframes are `completed`, also list the detected `.pen` artifact paths and export folders under `designs/{slug}/`.

- Every UC system response has a matching screen Behaviour Rule.
- Wireframes match their SRS screen descriptions field by field.
- Wireframes use Shadcn UI by default unless the user explicitly requests another system.
- SRS screens link to `.pen` artifacts and frame references unless wireframes were explicitly skipped or not applicable.
- Screen IDs stay aligned between SRS and Pencil frame names.
- Modal, drawer, and dialog overlays with flow impact are modeled as primary screens.
- Supporting state frames implied by screen behavior exist in `.pen` and are listed in the SRS screen inventory.
- Cross-references between FRD, user stories, and SRS are consistent.

## Token Efficiency

- Pass minimal context to downstream workers.
- Reuse the intake summary instead of the raw source once normalization is complete.
- Read templates once and pass only the relevant sections to each artifact owner.
- Split large use case or screen sets into smaller groups when needed.
- For wireframes, pass only the assigned screen slices rather than the full SRS.
