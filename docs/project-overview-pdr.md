# BA-kit Product Development Requirements

## Executive Summary

BA-kit is a commercial, production-grade Business Analysis toolkit for Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity runtimes. It transforms AI agents into structured BA workstations with lifecycle management, standardized artifacts, module-based collaboration, and professional stakeholder handoff. Designed for solo IT BAs, consulting teams, and product managers doing BA work.

**Current Status:** Production (v1.0+), active development with regular releases
**License:** Commercial proprietary source-available
**Codebase:** ~32K LOC across 251 files (MD, YAML, JSON, Python, Bash)

## Problem Statement

Agent coding environments are optimized for software implementation. Business analysis work requires different defaults:

- Structured elicitation and intake normalization before requirements authoring
- Single persisted source of truth (backbone) before formal and Agile artifacts are emitted
- Traceability from business goals through requirements to test cases
- Reusable templates for recurring deliverables (FRD, SRS, user stories, wireframe constraints)
- Module-based collaboration without forcing BAs to learn Git first
- Professional handoff packages for product, engineering, and operations teams

BA-kit closes this gap with a BA-first operating model and contract-first architecture.

## Vision & Value Proposition

**Vision:** Every AI agent can be a professional BA workstation.

**Value Proposition:**
- Reduce duplicated writing for solo analysts (templates + backbone-first authoring)
- Improve consistency of requirement quality and acceptance criteria (gated quality gates)
- Support Agile, Traditional, and Hybrid delivery styles (configurable mode)
- Enable non-technical BAs to collaborate without Git/CLI friction (natural language routing + dashboards)
- Accelerate handoff to engineering and operations (compiled HTML packages + traceability)

## Target Users

| User Type | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| Solo IT Business Analyst | Full lifecycle: intake → backbone → FRD/stories → SRS → wireframe constraints → package |
| Product Manager (BA work) | Requirements definition, user story generation, acceptance criteria |
| Consulting Team | Discovery engagement, requirements capture, stakeholder handoff |
| Solution Analyst | Module-based collaboration, cross-team coordination, change impact analysis |
| QA/Test Lead | UC/SRS audit for test readiness (via qc-uc-review skill) |

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Lifecycle Management
- **Intake & Normalization:** Structured elicitation, gap analysis, open questions tracking
- **Requirements Backbone:** Single source of truth after scope lock (vocabulary, decisions, assumptions)
- **Gated Artifact Emission:** FRD, user stories, SRS, wireframe constraints emitted only when prerequisites met
- **Quality Gates:** Pre-SRS (completeness), pre-wireframe (full 10-point audit), pre-package (cross-artifact consistency)
- **Packaging:** Compiled HTML deliverables for stakeholder review

### 2. Module Collaboration
- **Ownership & Scope:** Lead BA divides work, module BAs claim and author
- **Review Packets:** Structured handoff for Lead BA approval
- **Conflict Detection:** Automatic flagging of cross-module dependencies and shared decisions
- **GitHub Integration:** Optional PR/merge workflow (approval-gated, not automatic)

### 3. Reverse Mode (As-Built Documentation)
- **Baseline Lock:** Commit hash + evidence snapshot at start
- **Drift Detection:** Track changes to source code vs. documented behavior
- **Evidence-Based Promotion:** Only promote content with clear source evidence
- **No Speculation:** Reverse mode documents what exists, not future-state requests

### 4. Change Impact Analysis
- **Requirement Triage:** Classify changes by layer (intake, backbone, module, artifact)
- **Cascade Detection:** Identify downstream artifacts affected by change
- **Rerun Orchestration:** Automatically rerun affected layers with change context

### 5. Quality Assurance
- **QC-UC-Review Skill:** Platform-parameterized UC/SRS audit for test-readiness
- **Index-First Reads:** Guardrail enforcement for consistent artifact discovery
- **Validation Receipts:** Machine-readable proof of quality gate passage

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Contract-First Design** | Single source of truth (contract.yaml) for paths, commands, states, quality gates |
| **Behavior Shards** | Command-specific operating rules (intake, backbone, SRS, wireframes, etc.) |
| **Memory Tiers** | Hot (vocabulary, decisions), warm (module-scoped), cold (archived) |
| **Activation Levels** | Base (single project), modular (≥2 modules), program (cross-module deps) |
| **Natural Language Routing** | `/ba-do` intent router maps user language to safe workflows |
| **Project Home Dashboard** | BA-facing resume point with next-step guidance and runtime prompts |
| **Collaboration Dashboards** | COLLAB-HOME.md (lead view), MODULE-HOME.md (module BA view) |
| **Design System** | DESIGN.md runtime constraints for UI handoff (colors, fonts, navigation schema) |
| **Wireframe Constraints** | Manual handoff pack under `wireframes/` (`wireframe-input.md`, `wireframe-map.md`, `wireframe-state.md`) |
| **Compiled Packages** | HTML exports for stakeholder review (FRD, SRS, traceability matrix) |

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Installation time | < 5 minutes | Achieved |
| Non-technical BA resume | From PROJECT-HOME.md without CLI | Achieved |
| Module collaboration | No Git/PR learning required | Achieved |
| Requirement completeness | 100% have acceptance criteria | Achieved |
| Quality gate automation | 3 gates (pre-SRS, pre-wireframe, pre-package) | Achieved |
| Codex integration | Repo-native via AGENTS.md | Achieved |
| Antigravity integration | CLI + Knowledge Item workflow | Achieved |

## Design Decisions

1. **Single unified skill** (`ba-start`) instead of many disconnected skills for cohesive lifecycle
2. **Requirements backbone** is default authoring source after intake (not freestyle FRD)
3. **Four focused agent roles** (requirements-engineer, ui-ux-designer, ba-documentation-manager, ba-researcher) without overlap
4. **Templates are first-class assets** because BA deliverables are repeatable across projects
5. **PlantUML for swimlanes**, Mermaid for other diagrams (portable, markdown-native)
6. **Hybrid methodology default** for solo IT BA work (formal where risk is high, lightweight where speed matters)
7. **Gated artifact emission** (SRS/wireframes only when needed) instead of always emitting full set
8. **PROJECT-HOME.md is dashboard, not source of truth** (backbone → intake → module artifacts are canonical)
9. **GitHub is optional transport layer** (BA-facing state lives in Collab Home, Module Home, review packets)
10. **Contract-first architecture** (single contract.yaml for paths, commands, states, thresholds)
